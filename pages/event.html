        <h1>Event (Neuromorphic) Sensor</h1>
        <p>Event-based cameras are a novel sensor technology designed to process only changes in a scene,
           unlike traditional cameras that capture entire frames at regular intervals. Each pixel in an event-based sensor operates
           independently and react asynchronously to changes in brightness. The pixels only react when a change is detected.
           This makes event-based cameras highly energy-efficient and capable of capturing high-speed dynamic events.
