        <h1>RGB Camera</h1>
        <p>The RGB HDR Camera is a standard visual imaging device designed to capture images and videos with enhanced dynamic range. High Dynamic Range (HDR) 
          technology allows the camera to capture details in both very bright and very dark areas, making it suitable for various real-world lightning conditions. 
          In this project, the RGB HDR camera plays an important role in demonstrating machine learning applications.
