        <h1>Thermal (Infrared) sensor</h1>
        <p>
          Thermal Cameras, also known as infrared (IR) cameras or thermal imagers, are sophisticated devices that detect 
          and visualize the infrared radiation emitted by objects. Unlike conventional cameras that capture images based 
          on visible light, thermal cameras operate in the infrared spectrum, which is beyond the range of human vision. 
          This capability allows them to create images based on temperature differences, making heat visible [14].<br>
          All objects above absolute zero temperature emit infrared energy, and the intensity of this emission is related 
          to the object's temperature. Thermal cameras are equipped with an infrared detector (Sensor array or detector 
          chip), an optical system, often including specialized lenses made of materials like germanium, which are 
          transparent to infrared radiation. Thermal imaging technology is independent of any external light source 
          because it relies solely on the detection of emitted infrared radiation. This makes thermal cameras highly 
          effective in low-light or even completely dark conditions.  
        </p>
        <h2>Pipeline</h2>
        <p>
          The process to capture infrared energy and produce a digital image begins with infrared radiation emitted by 
          objects being captured. This radiation is then processed through the following stages to create a digital 
          thermal image: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Infrared optics: Unlike visible light cameras that typically use glass lenses, thermal cameras require 
            specialized optics made of materials that are transparent to infrared radiation, such as germanium. The 
            optical system of the thermal camera, including these specialized lenses, focuses the incoming infrared 
            energy onto the infrared sensor array [15]. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Infrared Sensor Array: The focused radiation then strikes the infrared sensor array, also known as the 
            detector chip, which contains thousands of detector pixels arranged in a grid. These pixels are made of 
            materials that react to infrared energy to convert it into an electronic signal. 
            <ul>
              <li>
                These sensors can be based on different technologies. Bolometer-based thermal detectors have high 
                thermal sensitivity, small size and high accuracy. A bolometer is a material whose electrical resistance 
                changes in response to incident infrared radiation. Common materials for bolometers include vanadium oxide 
                (VOx) and amorphous silicon (a-Si) [15].  
              </li>
              <li>
                Other types of thermal detectors include pyroelectrical and thermoelectrical sensors. Pyroelectric 
                sensors accumulate charge based on incident IR, while thermoelectric sensors generate voltage difference 
                based on temperature differences. 
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Signal processing unit: The electronic signal produced by each pixel in the sensor array is then processed 
            by the cameras built-in-software and a signal processing unit. 
            <ul>
              <li>
                The processor takes the signal from each pixel and applies mathematical calculations to create a colour 
                map representing the apparent temperature of the object. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Each temperature value is assigned a different colour in a process facilitated by a colour palette. 
                Typically, warmer areas are represented in lighter colours, and cooler areas are shown in darker colours. 
                This visual representation, known as a thermal image or thermogram, provides a detailed temperature map 
                of the surveyed area, highlighting temperature variations and potential anomalies.

        <h2>Infrared vs Visible Light</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike visible light cameras, which detect reflected light from a scene, thermal cameras detect emitted 
          infrared radiation, making hem highly effective in complete darkness and through obscurants such as smoke or 
          fog.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Detection Mechanism [14]: 
            <ul>
              <li>
                Visible light cameras operate by detecting visible light that is reflected off objects. They capture 
                different wavelengths within the visible spectrum (typically 400nm to 700nm) and convert them into an 
                image representing the colours and intensities of the reflected light. The operation of these cameras 
                relies on an external light source to illuminate the scene. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Thermal cameras, on the other hand, detect infrared radiation that is emitted by objects. All objects 
                above absolute zero emit this infrared energy as a function of their temperature. Thermal cameras measure 
                the intensity of this emitted IR radiation and convert it into a visual image, where different colours 
                represent different temperatures ranges. 
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Performance in darkness [16]: 
            <ul>
              <li>
                Because visible light cameras rely on reflected light, the perform poorly or not at all in complete 
                darkness. Without a source of visible light, there is nothing to detect and create and image from. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Thermal cameras are highly effective in complete darkness. Since they detect head naturally emitted by 
                objects, the absence of visible light has no impact on their ability to generate an image based on 
                temperature differences.  
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Performance with obscurants: 
            <ul>
              <li>
                Visible light cameras can be significantly hindered by obscurants such as smoke and fog. These particles 
                in the air can scatter and absorb visual light, reducing visibility and making it difficult for the camera 
                to capture a clear image. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Thermal cameras generally perform better through certain obscurant like smoke and fog compared to visible 
                light cameras. This is because infrared radiation has longer wavelengths than visible light and is 
                therefore less susceptible to scattering by small particles. However, it is important to note that dense 
                fog or heavy rain can still impact the performance of thermal cameras to some extent due to absorption by 
                water particles. 
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Colour Palettes</h2>
        <p>
          Since infrared radiation is invisible to the human eye, thermal images are often displayed using false-colour 
          palettes. These colour palettes are essential for translating the detected infrared energy into a visual 
          representation. Different colours are assigned to different temperature ranges, creating a temperature map of 
          the scene. Some commonly used colour schemes are: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>White hot:</strong> In this palette, hotter temperatures are represented by lighter colours, 
            progressing from black (cooler) to white(hottest). This palette is often intuitive as it aligns with 
            everyday association of white or bright colours with head, it can be useful for identifying sublet 
            temperature difference in hotter areas. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Black hot:</strong> this is the inverse of the white hot palette. Hotter temperatures are 
            represented by darker colours, ranging from white (cooler_ to black (hottest). This palette can be 
            beneficial for detecting minute temperature variations in cooler environments or when observing objects 
            that are generally hot against a cooler background.  
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rainbow:</strong> The rainbow palette uses a spectrum of colours to represent different temperatures, 
            often starting with blue or violet for cooler temperatures and progressing through green, yellow, orange and 
            finally red for hotter temperatures. This palette can provide a more distinct visual separation between 
            different temperature ranges, making it easier to identify multiple temperature gradients within a scene. 
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The choice of colour palette often depends on the specific application and the user's preference. Different 
          palettes can highlight different aspects of the thermal image, making certain temperature anomalies or patterns 
          more apparent [14].
