        <h1>LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)</h1>
        <p>Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is a laser-based sensor used to measure distance with high accuracy. LiDAR is widely used in 
          applications ranging from autonomous vehicles to terrain mapping. LiDAR works by emitting short pulses of laser light from its transmitter. 
          These pulses travel through air until they encounter an object. Once an object is encountered, the light is reflected towards the LiDAR sensors 
          receiver. The time it takes for the reflected light to return is known as time-of-flight. This time-of-flight data s used to calculate distance, 
          enabling the creation of detailed 3D maps and models.
          LiDAR is used in many sectors such as Autonomous vehicles, for real-time mapping and navigation. Geographical mapping to map terrains, forest and 
          urban areas. And for in robotics for obstacle detection and avoidance.
