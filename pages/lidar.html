        <h1>LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)</h1>
        <p>
          Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is a laser-based sensor used to measure distance with high accuracy. 
          LiDAR is widely used in applications ranging from autonomous vehicles to terrain mapping. LiDAR works by 
          emitting short pulses of laser light from its transmitter. These pulses travel through air until they encounter 
          an object. Once an object is encountered, the light is reflected towards the LiDAR sensor receiver. The time it 
          takes for the reflected light to return is known as the time-of-flight (TOF). This TOF data is used to calculate 
          distance, enabling the creation of detailed 3D maps and models. 
        </p>
        <h2>Types of LiDAR</h2>
        <p>
          LiDAR technologies have evolved to suit different applications, with variations in scanning methods, laser types
          , and operational environments. The two primary categories of LiDAR systems are mechanical scanning LiDAR and 
          solid-state LiDAR. 
        </p>
        <h3>Mechanical Scanning LiDAR</h3>
        <p>
          Mechanical scanning LiDAR has traditionally been the most widely used LiDAR system. It typically employs a 
          rotating mechanism that emits laser beams in a 360-degree horizontal motion. Some systems incorporate multiple 
          lasers arranged vertically to cover a vertical angle, capturing detailed point clouds with both horizontal and 
          vertical resolution.<br>
          These LiDARs frequently operate at a wavelength of 905 nm. The more vertical channels, the denser and more 
          detailed the point cloud will be.

        </figure>
        <h3>Solid State LiDAR</h3>
        <p>
          Solid-state LiDAR systems have emerged as more compact and robust alternatives to mechanical scanning LiDARs. 
          These systems eliminate moving parts, providing several advantages in terms of reliability and size. Key 
          technologies within solid-state LiDAR include Flash LiDAR, Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) LiDAR and 
          Optical Phased Array (OPA) LiDAR. 
        </p>
        <h4>Flash LiDAR</h4>
        <p>
          Flash LiDAR works by illuminating an entire scene in a single laser pulse. This broad laser beam is reflected 
          off the scene and detected by a 2D detector array, creating a depth map in a single shot. Flash LiDAR does not 
          construct the point cloud point by point or layer by layer.<br>
          Flash LiDAR systems typically operate at various wavelengths depending on the application, including 532nm,
          671nm,780nm and 905nm. Flash LiDAR is useful in applications that require rapid scene capture, such as 
          autonomous vehicles and robotic navigation. 
        </p>
        <h4>MEMS LiDAR</h4>
        <p>
          MEMS LiDAR uses a micro-electromechanical system to direct laser beams. A MEMS based mirror moves to ‘scan’ 
          the environment. These devices often use lasers in the visible (red or green) or Near-Infrared (NIR) spectrum.<br>
          MEMS LiDARs typically operate with wavelengths in the visible or NIR spectrum. MEMS LiDAR systems are compact and 
          well-suited for automotive and mobile applications, where small size and low power consumption are important. The 
          LiDAR sensor used on the sensor rig is a MEMS LiDAR. 
        </p>

        </figure>
        <h4>OPA LiDAR</h4>
        <p>
          OPA LiDAR uses optical phased arrays to steer the laser beams without moving parts.  This allows for highly 
          precise control over the direction of the laser, making it effective for long-range scanning.<br>
          OPA-based LiDAR systems commonly operate around 1550nm or tuneable wavelengths in the C+L band but can also 
          use 1300nm and 940nm wavelengths. 
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
          While these are the most used LiDAR types, many other variations exist, each tailored for specific applications. 
        </p>
        <h2>Laser</h2>
        <p>
          LiDAR systems utilize various types of lasers operating at different wavelengths. There are three primary 
          wavelength regions used in LiDAR systems: Near-Infrared, Visible and Short-Wave Infrared. 
        </p>
        <h3>Wavelengths</h3>
        <h4>Near-Infrared (NIR)</h4>
        <p>
          NIR excitation at 1064nm is commonly used for airborne topographic mapping.  There is an abundance of 
          commercially available laser sources and detectors, high reflectance from common targets like vegetation and 
          snow. However, this wavelength has the potential to be hazardous for the eyes, requiring either laser power 
          reduction or bean expansion to reduce the hazard. Another disadvantage is the large background noise 
          experienced in this part of the spectrum, particularly from the spectral irradiance of the sun. 
        </p>
        <h4>Visible (VIS)</h4>
        <p>
          VIS excitation at 532nm is often produced by doubling a 1064nm laser. VIS can be useful for underwater LiDAR 
          for bathymetric applications due to high transmission in pure water. 
        </p>
        <h4>Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR)</h4>
        <p>
          SWIR excitation at 1550nm uses ER-doped fibre lasers. SWIR is generally more eye-safe at higher power levels 
          and is typically used when solid bodies need to be detected eg in topography mapping and obstacle avoidance.  
        </p>
        <h3>Modulation Techniques</h3>
        <P>
          Besides the pulsed approach of ToF, LiDAR systems also use different modulation techniques to measure distances. 
        </P>
        <h4>Amplitude Modulated Continuous Wave (AMCW) LiDAR</h4>
        <p>
          Instead of pulses, AMCW LiDAR emits a continuous laser signal whose amplitude is modulated with a specific 
          frequency or pattern. The distance to the target is determined by analysing the phase shift of the modulation 
          pattern in the reflected signal compared to the emitted signal. AMCW LiDAR is suitable for moderate-range 
          sensing.  
        </p>
        <h4>Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) LiDAR</h4>
        <p>
          FMCW LiDAR emits a continuous laser signal whose frequency is modulated over time (often a linear increase or 
          a triangular waveform). The distance and velocity of a moving object can be obtained from the beat frequency 
          between the emitted and received signals. 
        </p>
        <h2>Receiver</h2>
        <p>
          The receiver in a LiDAR system is crucial for detecting the reflected laser signals and converting them into 
          electronic data. Key components that facilitate this process include: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Photodiodes are essential for the initial conversion of light into electrical signals. Different types of 
            photodiodes are used in LiDAR receivers: 
            <ul>
              <li>
                Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs) provide internal gain, making them suitable for detecting weak return signals, 
                especially in longer-range LiDAR applications. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Single-Photon Avalanche diodes (SPADs) are utilized in flash LiDAR systems for precise ToF measurements. 
                SPAD arrays enable the capture of 3D depth images with a single shot of an optical pulse. 
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Optical Filters are used to enhance signal-to-noise ratio by blocking unwanted ambient light or other 
            interfering wavelengths. For instance, a receiver might have a specific filter bandwidth to optimize 
            detection during day or night. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Timing circuits are critical for measuring ToF of the laser pulses with high precision. The accuracy of the 
            distance measurement in pulsed ToF LiDAR is limited by the resolution in time counting, which is mainly 
            determined by the electronics timing resolution. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) are necessary to convert the analogue electrical signals from the 
            photodetectors into digital data that can be processed by the systems electronics. 
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Pipeline</h2>
        <p>
          A LiDAR system follows a structured pipeline to capture, process and interpret environmental data. 
          The Primary stages include: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Laser Emission: A laser pulse is emitted towards the target environment. The lasers wavelength, pulse 
            duration and power determine the accuracy and range. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Interaction with the Target: The emitted pulse interacts with surfaces in the environment, and a portion of 
            the light is reflected back towards the sensor. The reflection intensity depends on the surface properties 
            such as reflectivity and texture. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Time-of-Flight (ToF) Measurement: The system calculates the distance based on ToF data. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Point cloud generation: the captured measurements form a 3D point cloud, with each point corresponding to 
            (x,y,z) coordinates. 
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Point Cloud</h2>
        <p>
          Point clouds are formed by LiDAR systems through a process that involves acquiring spatial data and associating 
          coordinates with numerous points in a scanned surface. The detailed steps in this process are as follows: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Data Acquisition: Laser pulses scan the environment and calculated the ToF  
          </li>
          <li>
            Georeferencing:  
            <ul>
              <li>
                To provide real-world context to the point cloud data, information from a Global Positioning System (GPS) 
                and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is integrated with the LiDAR measurements.
              </li>
              <li>
                The GPS navigation system records the absolute position (latitude, longitude, altitude) of the sensor 
                platform. 
              </li>
              <li>
                The IMU records the angular attitude (roll, pitch, yaw) of the platform, compensating for any movement 
                or instability during data collection.
              </li>
              <li>
                By synchronizing the LiDAR measurements with the GPS and IMU data, each point in the cloud is assigned 
                accurate geographical coordinates, effectively ‘georeferencing’ the point cloud. This allows the point 
                cloud to be accurately related to a geographic or local coordinate system. 
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Point Cloud Generation: 
            <ul>
              <li>
                The numerous individual distance measurements and their corresponding spatial coordinates are combined 
                to form the point cloud, which is a collection of vertices in a three-dimensional coordinate system. 
                These points are intended to represent the exterior surface of the scanned objects or environment. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Each point in the point cloud can contain additional attributes beyond just the (X, Y, Z) coordinates, 
                such as the intensity of the reflected laser pulse. 
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Data Filtering: 
            <ul>
              <li>
                The raw point cloud data often contains noise (eg stray points, atmospheric interference) and may have a 
                very high density of points. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Data filtering techniques are applied to remove this unwanted noise and improve the quality of the 
                point cloud.  
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
    </body>
