                    <h3>Skaiste Motiejunaite</h3>
                    <p>
                        I created this website as a supplemental for my masters project. The idea was to have a 
                        tool that provides a comprehensive overview of the various sensors of the rig, in the hopes 
                        of making it easier for others to learn about them. <br><br>
                        I have a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electronic and Computer Engineering, and am currently completing 
                        a masters in the same field. <br>
                        The reason I chose to pursue ECE is that it offers a balance between hardware and software. It is 
                        very rewarding to know that, not only can I build something, but I can also program it to function 
                        as intended.<br><br>
                        Considering that it gave me the possibility to work with different kinds of sensors, rather than just one, 
                        I decided to pick this project. Additionally, the fact that it was more software based, which is what I have 
                        grown to appreciate most during my studies, further convinced me.<br>
                        My favourite parts with this project were the designing, the implementation and the solving challenges regarding 
                        the integration of all the different sensors into the app.<br>
                        I also enjoyed building this website to go with the app, because it brings the whole project together, and it 
                        gives the opportunity for anyone interested to learn more about it.<br><br>
                        I hope you will like it too!
